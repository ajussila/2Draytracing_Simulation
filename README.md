Ray Tracing Code for 2018 Honors Project,
Oberlin College Department of Physics

This is a code that is designed to take a set of rays and launch them from a pulsar to a an observer point. Along the path, the rays experience deflections consistent with the setup that the used chooses. The starting parameters include an average deflection angle at a given point, a number of rays, the strength of each deflection, the axial raio of coherent deflections, and the inclination of the coherent screen deflection.

This allows for a versatile way to manipulate the simulation in order to see the resulting spectra. The final output is a 4 panel setup with a ray tracing representation, a dynamic spectrum, a secondary spectrum, and a wavefield plot. Each of these shows slightly different things.
